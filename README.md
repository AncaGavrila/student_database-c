Description:
This is a simple console program I made in C to manage a list of students. The program lets you:

Add new students with ID, name, and grade
Delete students by their ID
Show all students
Search for students by name (you can type part of the name)
Sort students by grade from highest to lowest
Save the students to a file (database.txt)
Load the students from the file when the program starts

I used:

struct to store student information

Dynamic memory (malloc and realloc)

File reading and writing (fopen, fscanf, fprintf)

Simple sorting and searching algorithms

A menu to choose what you want to do

This project helped me practice C programming, working with files, and handling data in memory. It’s a project that I built as a second-year student to understand more about programming and data management.
